IR-based Molecular Functional Group Identifier

Developed the IR-based Molecular Functional Group Identifier to identify the unknown functional groups in organic compounds, using 2000+ computational Infrared spectroscopy (IR) data from Alexandria Library.
Conducted EDA and feature engineering on spectrum data for chemicals; used SMOTE for imbalanced data.

Trained and optimized binary classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost).

XGBoost shows as the best-performing model with a 0.92 precision score on average for all functional groups.
Saved 85% of computational time and labor costs for data analysis.
